# Python App

This is a simple python web application that shows the current time in Moscow timezone.

## Framework

I chose the Flask framework for this task because it's easy to use, has clear documentation, and provides the bare minimum of functionality.

## Best practices & Coding standarts 

Since the task is quite simple, it is difficult to demonstrate the use of all the best practices. I considered it unnecessary to deliberately complicate the logic, but here are the practices that should be followed when writing programs in Python:


1. PEP 8 is the official coding standard for the Python language. It defines rules and guidelines for formatting code, naming variables and functions, using comments, and so on.

2. Modules and packages - modules allow you to organize code into logically related blocks, and packages allow you to group modules by topic. This simplifies the maintenance and expansion of the program.

3. Tests - testing helps to identify errors and defects in the program. Writing tests is a good practice to make sure the program works correctly.
